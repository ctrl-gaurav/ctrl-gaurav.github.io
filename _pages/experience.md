### Machine Learning Engineer
*Aug 2023 - Jul 2024* | Hyderabad, Telangana, India
* Developed **DDS-GPT**, a RAG-based tool using Google flan-t5-large LLM and instructor-xl embeddings that utilizes Dell Design System (DDS) documentation to generate code snippets for UI components, saving UI developer's manual efforts
* Automated the entire Product Experience Platform (PXP) CDO metrics dashboard, saving ∼ 4 days of manual effort per sprint for every product manager in Dell's eCommerce Org
* Worked with cross-functional teams to improve a Gedis class predictor, resulting in a **12% increase in SKU accuracy**
* Engineered a customer support bot using a Dell-hosted fine-tuned Llama2-70B chat LLM on Dell's Jira Data to dynamically route incident tickets to appropriate SMEs, reducing **40% of SLA times**
* Led the adoption of MLOps within Dell's ecommerce Org, enhancing ML models monitoring and automating retraining processes
* Built a dynamic forecasting system for the Product Data Service Layer team to alert 59 clients, saving infra cost by ∼ **40%**

### SDE Intern (Machine Learning)
*Feb 2023 - May 2023* | Hyderabad, Telangana, India
* Developed Machine Learning capabilities to analyze and extract precise error patterns within daily failed Job Logs for the Enterprise Business Intelligence (EBI) team, contributing to enhanced data-driven insights and decision-making processes
* Fine-tuned the **RobertaBert** using Splunk Tables' generated Error Logs data, achieving an F1-score of **98.03%** with an inference time of 22 min 36s for 10 million records
* Devised and implemented a combined model pipeline integrating Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, and XGBoost, strategically dividing data based on the best-performing model for each data pattern cluster, resulting in a significant reduction of inference time to **3 min 41s** for 10 million records
* Designed end-to-end ML ingestion pipeline to systematically monitor and retrain the model whenever failure jobs deviated from the existing cluster scope, ensuring continuous model relevance and accuracy
* Deployed and Operationalized the model on Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF), optimizing processing speed to **18ms per record** while efficiently handling batches of 1000 records in 3.2s

### SDE Intern (Data Science & Automation)
*Jun 2022 - Sep 2022* | Hyderabad, Telangana, India
* Worked with the Enterprise Business Intelligence (EBI) team to automate and enhance data reliability processes, streamlining data workflows and ensuring data integrity
* Developed a feature for D'Owl tool to remove feature-level duplicates from records, enhancing data quality and reducing redundancy
* Optimized the D'owl codebase, reducing processing time from an initial 7.68 milliseconds to an astonishing **997 microseconds** for 1 record
* Explored NLP capabilities to extract valuable information from emojis rather than simply removing them from records
